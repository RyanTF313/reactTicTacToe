This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Tic-tac-toe

Made by following the React.js tutorial found [here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). After finishing tutorial I also did the 6 extra steps at the end and some design edits. Enjoy!!

### npm start

Runs the app
<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
